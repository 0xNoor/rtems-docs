Boilerplate File Header
==========================================


Every file should include two comment header blocks, one for the Doxygen output and a copyright notice.  This is a typical example:

.. code block:: shell
/**
 * @file
 *
 * @ingroup TheGroupForThisFile
 *
 * @brief Short "Table of Contents" Description of File Contents
 *
 * A short description of the purpose of this file.
 */

/*
 * Copyright (c) 20XX Your Name Or Your Company.
 *
 * The license and distribution terms for this file may be
 * found in the file LICENSE in this distribution or at
 * https://www.rtems.org/license/LICENSE.
 */



 *  Use exactly one blank line between the Doxygen header and copyright notice. Leave the first line of the copyright notice blank.
 *  Separate the Doxygen header and copyright notice so the copyright notice is not included in the Doxygen output.
 *  The copyright owner and specific license terms may vary.
