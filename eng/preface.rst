Preface
*******

The Real Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems (RTEMS) operating
systems is a layered system with each of the public APIs implemented in
terms of a common foundation layer called the SuperCore. RTEMS provides
full capabilities for management of tasks, interrupts time, and multiple
processors in addition to those features typical of generic operating
systems. RTEMS has been implemented in both the Ada and C programming
languages.

.. topic: RTEMS Mission Statement

  RTEMS development aims to provide a free deterministic real-time operating
  system targeted towards deeply embedded systems which is competitive
  with closed source products. The RTEMS project encourages the support
  and use of standard APIs in order to promote application portability
  and ease porting other packages to the RTEMS environment. Source:

The RTEMS development effort uses an open development environment in
which all users collaborate to improve RTEMS. The RTEMS cross development
toolset is based upon the free GNU tools and the open source C Library
newlib. RTEMS supports many host platforms and target architectures.
