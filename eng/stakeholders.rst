RTEMS Stakeholders
******************

RTEMS is a community based open source project. All users are treated
as stakeholders. It is hoped that as stakeholders, users will contribute
to the project, sponsor core developers, and help fund the infrastructure
required to host and manage the project.

Qualification - Stakeholder Involvement
=======================================

Qualification of RTEMS is a specialized activity and only specific users
of RTEMS will complete a formal qualification activity. The RTEMS Project
cannot self-fund this entire activity and requires stakeholder to invest
in an ongoing basis to ensure the any investment they make is maintained
and viable in an ongoing basis. The RTEMS core developers view steady
support of the qualification effort as necessary to continue to lower
the overall costs of qualification RTEMS.
