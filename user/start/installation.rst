Installation
============

.. index:: Installation

RTEMS is built from source on your host machine. Releases are available from
our :r:url:`ftp` and each release contains a Quick Start build guide. If you
are wanting to track changes to RTEMS as they happen or you want to make
changes to RTEMS to send back to the project on our :r:list:`devel` then you
can use the developer's version available in our :r:url:`git`.

RTEMS supports development on a wide vararity of hosts. There is no preferred
host operating system the project requires you use. This means you are able to
decide on a host operating system that is your passion, suites your needs, or
in some cases is decided for you by your employer. Our aim is to provide a
consistent user experience and on matching hardware the experience should feel
similar.

The RTEMS core development team uses POSIX type operating systems, that is
Unix.  The :ref:`released-version` and :ref:`development-version` sections
assume Unix. Microsoft Windows is documented in a separate section
:ref:`microsoft-windows-installation`.
