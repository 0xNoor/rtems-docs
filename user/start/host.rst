Host Computer Setup
===================

The *host computer* is the thing you use to develop applications.  It runs all
your tools, editors, documentation viewers, etc.  To get started with RTEMS
development you need other tools.  This includes a native C, C++ and Python
development environment.  Please make sure that you can build native C/C++
applications on your host computer.  You must be able to build native Python C
modules.  Usually you have to install a Python development package for this.
Please have a look at the :ref:`Host Computer <host-computer>` chapter for the
glory details.  In particular :ref:`Microsoft Windows <microsoft-windows>` user
should do this.
