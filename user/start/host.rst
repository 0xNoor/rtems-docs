Prepare Your Host Computer
==========================

The *host computer* is a computer you use to develop applications.  It runs all
your tools, editors, documentation viewers, etc.  To get started with RTEMS
development you need tools from your host's operating system to build the RTEMS
tool suite from source.  This is not a one-click installation process, but
there are :ref:`good reasons <WhyBuildFromSource>` to build everything from
source.  You need a native C, C++ and Python development environment.  Please
make sure that you can build native C/C++ applications on your host computer.
You must be able to build native Python C modules.  Usually, you have to
install a Python development package for this.  Please have a look at the
:ref:`Host Computer <host-computer>` chapter for the gory details.  In
particular :ref:`Microsoft Windows <microsoft-windows>` user should do this.
